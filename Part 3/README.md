# Data Preprocessing and Wrangling

## Question 

<b>

You are requested to use data set which you have created during Activity-1. If the
data set does not have missing data or enough data (Data set should have minimum
200 Rows), you can obtain random data set from internet. If there are no missing
values, you can randomly remove some of the values and create missing data set.
Then apply the following algorithms for dropping or imputing missing data,
(Note: You can either directly read the data set from URL or upload and read from
your GITHUB repository)

<ol>
<li>Remove the columns and rows having missing data more than 60% </li>
<li>Apply Mean or Median for Imputing Missing Values in remaining columns </li>
<li>Apply any other standard algorithm for imputing missing values (for at least
one column). </li>
</ol>
